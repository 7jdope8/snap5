<h3>AOI Monitoring</h3><p>The Area Of Interests (AOI)
Monitoring&nbsp;allows users to specify, save, and load AOIs to be
automatically batched processed using a chain of processing steps
defined with the Graph Builder.<br></p><p>AOIs can be specified
graphically by drawing polygons on the world map. AOIs can be saved and reloaded
without requiring the user to re-enter any parameters.</p><p>You may
also specify which types of products to use based on the fields in the
metadata database. Thereby, the user can specify to only process for
example Radarasat 2 SLC products from a specific date forward etc.</p><p>The
user must specify the input folder where to scan recursively for new
products, the output folder where to save the processed results, the
processing graph and the scheduled time to begin scanning and
processing.</p><p><img style="width: 706px; height: 430px;" alt="" src="images/aoi_monitoring.jpg"></p><p>The
software then queries the Product Library database of product metadata
to determine which local stored products partially or entirely fall
within the AOI and selects the best appropriate image pairs based on
geolocation, product type, pass, resolution, acquisition time and
baseline.</p><p>When new products are found by the system that
are covered in whole or partially by an AOI, the system will trigger
the processing chain for that AOI to be queued for processing.</p><p>There is no limit to the number of AOIs that can be
defined for monitoring. Processing for multiple AOIs will be queued.&nbsp;</p><p></p><hr>
