<h4><a name="processingParameters">Processing parameters</a></h4>

<p>This preferences page provides options to customize processing parameters.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>SNAP Values</b><br>
        There are three processing parameters that may affect processing performance:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Tile size</b><br>
                Defines the default tile size in pixels.
            </li>
            <li><b>Cache size</b><br>
                Defines the default cache size in MB.
            </li>
            <li><b>Nb threads</b><br>
                Sets the available number of threads.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><b>Benchmark</b><br>
        To help you to define faster processing parameters, you can launch benchmarks.

        You need to define a list of possible processing parameters for each values (tile size, cache size and nb threads).
        Each list must have at least one value, otherwise each values must be separated by a semi-colon (;).
        Then choose in the <b>Proc. graph</b> combobox the processing that will be used by the benchmark.
        Finally, press the button <b>Compute</b> to launch the processing dialog, sets processing parameters and <b>Run</b>.
        The benchmark will compute the processing with all given parameters and save the better result in <b>SNAP Values</b>.
    </li>
</ul>
